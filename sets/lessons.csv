Architecture,1,"THE IMPORTANCE OF THRESHOLDS","Architect Christopher Alexander taught that thresholds - the spaces between inside and outside - are crucial for human comfort. A good threshold provides a gradual transition rather than an abrupt change. This applies to physical spaces, user interfaces, and organizational boundaries. When designing any system, create buffer zones and transitional spaces that help people adjust gradually rather than forcing sudden shifts.","School of Architecture"
Architecture,2,"DESIGNING FOR HUMAN SCALE","Jane Jacobs observed that cities work best when designed for pedestrians, not cars. Buildings and spaces should relate to human proportions and movement patterns. This principle extends beyond physical design - organizational structures, user interfaces, and processes should be sized appropriately for human cognition and behavior rather than optimized for abstract efficiency.","School of Architecture"
Architecture,3,"FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION","Louis Sullivan's principle that the shape of a building should follow its intended function revolutionized design thinking. Before decorating or optimizing, first deeply understand the core purpose and requirements. This applies to software design, business processes, and team structures - let the essential function drive the form, not the other way around.","School of Architecture"
Architecture,4,"THE POWER OF NATURAL LIGHT","Architect Louis Kahn believed that natural light should be the primary consideration in any design. Spaces feel more alive and human when they connect to natural rhythms and light sources. In any environment you create - physical or digital - consider how to incorporate natural elements, variability, and connections to the outside world rather than creating sterile, artificial environments.","School of Architecture"
Architecture,5,"CONTEXTUAL DESIGN THINKING","Great architecture responds to its specific site, climate, and cultural context rather than imposing a universal solution. Hassan Fathy demonstrated this by using local materials and traditional building techniques in modern designs. When solving problems, first understand the unique constraints and opportunities of your specific context before applying generic best practices.","School of Architecture"
Architecture,6,"UNIVERSAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES","Architect Ron Mace developed universal design - creating spaces usable by all people regardless of age, ability, or status. Designing for the most constrained user often creates better solutions for everyone. When creating systems, processes, or products, consider the most challenging use cases first - solutions that work for edge cases are usually more robust and inclusive.","School of Architecture"
Architecture,7,"THE GENIUS LOCI CONCEPT","Architect Christian Norberg-Schulz emphasized that every place has a unique spirit or character that should be preserved and enhanced. Before changing any environment, spend time understanding its existing culture, rhythms, and unspoken rules. Successful interventions build on what already works rather than starting from scratch.","School of Architecture"
Architecture,8,"LAYERED COMPLEXITY","Architect Christopher Alexander's pattern language shows how complex, beautiful environments emerge from simple rules applied at multiple scales. Instead of trying to control every detail, create good underlying principles and let complexity emerge naturally. This applies to organizational design, software architecture, and community building.","School of Architecture"
Architecture,9,"ADAPTIVE REUSE PRINCIPLES","Architect Julia Morgan demonstrated that renovating existing structures often creates more interesting and sustainable results than building new. Before discarding existing systems, processes, or structures, look for ways to adapt and repurpose them. The constraints of working with existing elements often spark more creative solutions.","School of Architecture"
Architecture,10,"BUILDING FOR PERMANENCE","Traditional master builders designed structures to last centuries by understanding materials deeply and building in redundancy. In an age of rapid change, there's value in creating some elements that are deliberately permanent and stable. Identify what should endure in your systems and invest extra effort in making those elements robust and timeless.","School of Architecture"
Law,1,"BURDEN OF PROOF CLARITY","Justice Brandeis emphasized that in any dispute, clearly establishing who must prove what prevents endless arguments. Before starting any negotiation or decision-making process, explicitly agree on what evidence is required and who is responsible for providing it. This prevents debates from devolving into 'he said, she said' scenarios and creates clear resolution paths.","School of Law"
Law,2,"PRECEDENT AND CONSISTENCY","The legal principle of stare decisis (let the decision stand) creates predictability and fairness by treating similar cases similarly. When making decisions in your organization, document the reasoning and apply consistent principles to similar situations. This builds trust and reduces the need to re-argue the same issues repeatedly.","School of Law"
Law,3,"DUE PROCESS PROTECTION","Constitutional due process ensures people have notice and opportunity to be heard before adverse decisions affect them. Before implementing changes that impact others, provide clear advance notice, explain the reasoning, and create genuine opportunities for input. This prevents resentment and often improves the final decision through broader perspective.","School of Law"
Law,4,"DISCOVERY AND TRANSPARENCY","Legal discovery requires parties to share relevant information before trial, preventing surprise attacks and enabling fair resolution. In business and personal relationships, establish norms for sharing relevant information early and completely. Hidden information usually surfaces eventually and causes more damage when revealed late.","School of Law"
Law,5,"ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION","Mediation and arbitration often achieve better outcomes than adversarial litigation because they focus on interests rather than positions. When conflicts arise, explore collaborative problem-solving approaches before resorting to formal procedures or authority-based decisions. Understanding underlying interests often reveals solutions that satisfy everyone.","School of Law"
Law,6,"CONTRACT INTERPRETATION","Good contracts anticipate potential misunderstandings and address them explicitly upfront. When creating agreements - formal or informal - invest time in clarifying expectations, defining key terms, and discussing potential scenarios. What seems obvious to you may not be obvious to others, and clarity prevents most disputes.","School of Law"
Law,7,"FIDUCIARY DUTY STANDARDS","Lawyers and trustees must put their clients' interests ahead of their own and avoid conflicts of interest. When you hold any position of trust or authority, regularly examine whether your decisions are truly serving others' best interests or your own convenience. Transparency about potential conflicts maintains trust and credibility.","School of Law"
Law,8,"EVIDENCE-BASED REASONING","Legal arguments succeed based on admissible evidence and logical reasoning, not rhetoric or emotion. When advocating for decisions or changes, focus on verifiable facts and clear logical connections. Emotional appeals may work temporarily but evidence-based arguments create lasting conviction and buy-in.","School of Law"
Law,9,"REASONABLE PERSON STANDARD","Many legal decisions ask what a reasonable person would do in similar circumstances. This provides an objective standard that transcends individual preferences. When facing difficult decisions, consider what a reasonable, well-informed person would conclude based on available information, not just what you prefer or what's easiest.","School of Law"
Law,10,"STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS","Legal systems impose time limits on when claims can be brought to encourage prompt resolution and prevent stale disputes. In your work and relationships, address issues promptly rather than letting them accumulate. Old grievances become harder to resolve fairly as memories fade and circumstances change.","School of Law"
Design,1,"FORM AND FUNCTION BALANCE","Dieter Rams' principle that good design is as little design as possible revolutionized product thinking. Every element should serve a purpose, and ornamentation that doesn't enhance function creates confusion. When creating anything - products, processes, presentations - regularly ask what can be removed without losing essential functionality.","School of Design"
Design,2,"USER-CENTERED DESIGN","IDEO's human-centered design approach starts with deep empathy for actual users rather than assumptions about what they need. Before designing solutions, spend significant time observing and talking with the people who will actually use what you create. Your assumptions about user needs are probably wrong in important ways.","School of Design"
Design,3,"ITERATIVE PROTOTYPING","Designer Tom Kelley taught that building quick, rough prototypes teaches you more than extensive planning. Make your ideas tangible as quickly as possible, test them with real users, and iterate based on feedback. The fastest way to fail is to build the wrong thing perfectly on the first try.","School of Design"
Design,4,"CONSTRAINT-DRIVEN CREATIVITY","Graphic designer Paul Rand demonstrated that constraints spark creativity rather than limiting it. When facing creative challenges, impose artificial limitations - budget, time, materials, or features. Constraints force you to focus on essential elements and often lead to more elegant, innovative solutions.","School of Design"
Design,5,"VISUAL HIERARCHY PRINCIPLES","Typographer Jan Tschichold showed that clear visual hierarchy guides attention and comprehension. The most important information should be most prominent, with secondary elements appropriately de-emphasized. This applies to presentations, documents, user interfaces, and even meeting agendas - structure information to guide understanding.","School of Design"
Design,6,"AFFORDANCES AND SIGNIFIERS","Don Norman's research on affordances reveals that good design makes correct actions obvious and incorrect actions difficult or impossible. When creating any system, ensure that the right way to use it is the easiest and most natural way. If people consistently use something wrong, the design is the problem, not the users.","School of Design"
Design,7,"DESIGN THINKING PROCESS","Stanford d.school's design thinking methodology - empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test - provides a structured approach to innovation. When facing complex challenges, resist jumping immediately to solutions. Instead, invest time in understanding the problem deeply before generating multiple potential approaches and testing them systematically.","School of Design"
Design,8,"ACCESSIBILITY AS UNIVERSAL DESIGN","Designer Susan Kare's work on computer interfaces showed that designing for accessibility often creates better experiences for everyone. Consider users with different abilities, devices, contexts, and expertise levels. Solutions that work for the most constrained users usually work better for typical users too.","School of Design"
Design,9,"EMOTIONAL DESIGN IMPACT","Designer Jonathan Ive emphasized that products should create positive emotional connections, not just functional utility. People's feelings about using something are as important as whether it technically works. Consider the emotional experience you're creating, not just the functional requirements you're meeting.","School of Design"
Design,10,"SYSTEMS THINKING APPROACH","Designer Charles Eames viewed every design challenge as part of a larger system of relationships. Before optimizing individual components, understand how they connect to and affect the broader context. The best local solution might create system-wide problems, while system optimization might require local trade-offs.","School of Design"
Psychology,1,"COGNITIVE LOAD MANAGEMENT","Psychologist George Miller's research on working memory limits showed that people can only process 7±2 pieces of information simultaneously. When presenting information or designing experiences, chunk complex information into smaller, manageable pieces. Cognitive overload leads to poor decisions and user frustration.","School of Psychology"
Psychology,2,"LOSS AVERSION EFFECTS","Daniel Kahneman's research revealed that people feel losses about twice as strongly as equivalent gains. When proposing changes, frame them in terms of what people will lose by not changing rather than what they'll gain by changing. Address anticipated losses explicitly rather than ignoring them.","School of Psychology"
Psychology,3,"SOCIAL PROOF INFLUENCE","Robert Cialdini's research on influence showed that people look to others' behavior to determine appropriate actions, especially in uncertain situations. When encouraging adoption of new behaviors, prominently display evidence that others are already doing it successfully. Social proof is more powerful than logical arguments.","School of Psychology"
Psychology,4,"GROWTH MINDSET POWER","Carol Dweck's research on mindset revealed that believing abilities can be developed leads to greater achievement than believing abilities are fixed. When giving feedback or facing challenges, focus on effort, strategy, and learning rather than inherent talent or intelligence. Frame setbacks as information rather than judgments.","School of Psychology"
Psychology,5,"PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY","Harvard's Amy Edmondson found that teams perform better when members feel safe to admit mistakes, ask questions, and propose ideas without fear of punishment or embarrassment. Create environments where intellectual risk-taking is rewarded and failure is treated as learning opportunity rather than character flaw.","School of Psychology"
Psychology,6,"CONFIRMATION BIAS AWARENESS","Psychologist Peter Wason's research showed that people seek information that confirms their existing beliefs and ignore contradictory evidence. When making important decisions, actively seek out disconfirming evidence and opposing viewpoints. Assign someone to play devil's advocate to counteract natural confirmation bias.","School of Psychology"
Psychology,7,"INTRINSIC MOTIVATION DRIVERS","Edward Deci's self-determination theory identified autonomy, mastery, and purpose as key motivators. External rewards often undermine intrinsic motivation for creative tasks. Instead of relying primarily on carrots and sticks, focus on giving people choice in how they work, opportunities to develop expertise, and connection to meaningful outcomes.","School of Psychology"
Psychology,8,"ANCHORING EFFECT IMPACT","Amos Tversky's research on anchoring showed that the first number people see heavily influences their subsequent judgments, even when the anchor is completely irrelevant. When negotiating or presenting options, carefully consider what anchors you're setting. The first proposal shapes everything that follows.","School of Psychology"
Psychology,9,"HABIT FORMATION LOOPS","BJ Fogg's behavior model shows that habits form when triggers, ability, and motivation align. To create positive changes, make desired behaviors easier to do, increase motivation through connection to existing values, and create consistent environmental triggers. Small changes in context often produce large behavior changes.","School of Psychology"
Psychology,10,"EMPATHY GAP UNDERSTANDING","Psychologist George Loewenstein discovered that people struggle to predict their future emotional states and needs. When people are calm, they underestimate how they'll feel when stressed, and vice versa. Make important decisions when you're in a neutral emotional state, and plan for how your needs might change.","School of Psychology"
Engineering,1,"REDUNDANCY AND FAIL-SAFES","Aerospace engineers build multiple backup systems because single points of failure create catastrophic risks. Identify the critical components in your systems - processes, people, technologies - and create backup options. When something absolutely cannot fail, never rely on a single solution, no matter how reliable it seems.","School of Engineering"
Engineering,2,"SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION THINKING","Industrial engineer W. Edwards Deming taught that optimizing individual components often makes the overall system worse. Before improving any part of a process, understand how it connects to and affects other parts. The bottleneck determines system performance, not the fastest component.","School of Engineering"
Engineering,3,"ITERATIVE TESTING METHODOLOGY","Test engineers know that assumptions about how systems will behave in the real world are often wrong. Build in feedback loops and measurement points so you can detect problems early and adjust course. Test early, test often, and test with real conditions rather than ideal laboratory settings.","School of Engineering"
Engineering,4,"MARGIN OF SAFETY PRINCIPLES","Structural engineers design buildings to withstand forces much greater than expected maximum loads. In any system you design, build in buffers for unexpected stresses, whether they're technical, financial, or human. Operating at maximum theoretical capacity leaves no room for the inevitable surprises.","School of Engineering"
Engineering,5,"ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS","When engineers investigate failures, they use techniques like 'Five Whys' to find underlying causes rather than just fixing symptoms. When problems occur in your work, resist the urge to quickly patch the immediate issue. Dig deeper to understand why the problem occurred and prevent similar issues in the future.","School of Engineering"
Engineering,6,"MODULAR DESIGN BENEFITS","Software engineers use modular design to create systems that are easier to understand, test, and modify. Break complex challenges into smaller, independent components with clear interfaces between them. Changes to one module shouldn't break others, and you should be able to understand each piece in isolation.","School of Engineering"
Engineering,7,"CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT CYCLES","Manufacturing engineers use techniques like Kaizen to make small, incremental improvements continuously rather than waiting for major overhauls. Establish regular review cycles to identify and implement small improvements. Many small optimizations compound into significant improvements over time.","School of Engineering"
Engineering,8,"DOCUMENTATION AND KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER","Engineers document their designs so others can understand, maintain, and improve them. Create clear documentation of your processes, decisions, and reasoning - not just the final outputs. Future you and other team members will need to understand why things were done certain ways.","School of Engineering"
Engineering,9,"SCALING AND PERFORMANCE LIMITS","Computer engineers must understand how systems behave as they grow larger. Solutions that work at small scale often break down as volume increases. When designing processes or systems, consider how they'll perform with 10x or 100x more users, data, or complexity.","School of Engineering"
Engineering,10,"TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS","Engineers constantly balance competing requirements - cost vs. performance, speed vs. reliability, simplicity vs. features. Make trade-offs explicit rather than hoping you can optimize everything simultaneously. Understand what you're giving up to get what you want, and make sure the trade-off aligns with your priorities.","School of Engineering"
Film,1,"SHOW DON'T TELL PRINCIPLE","Master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa believed that cinema's power comes from visual storytelling rather than exposition. Instead of explaining what people should think or feel, create experiences that let them draw their own conclusions. This applies to presentations, training, and leadership - demonstrate rather than lecture.","Film School"
Film,2,"THE POWER OF EDITING","Editor Walter Murch taught that the magic of film happens in the editing room, where meaning is created through the juxtaposition of images. The way you sequence and connect ideas determines their impact more than the individual pieces. Pay attention to transitions and the flow between concepts, not just the content itself.","Film School"
Film,3,"CHARACTER-DRIVEN NARRATIVE","Screenwriter Robert McKee emphasized that audiences connect with characters, not plots. The most compelling stories emerge from character motivations and conflicts rather than external events. When presenting ideas or leading change, focus on the human stakes and personal impacts rather than abstract benefits.","Film School"
Film,4,"VISUAL COMPOSITION RULES","Cinematographer Roger Deakins uses composition techniques like the rule of thirds to guide viewer attention and create emotional impact. How you frame and present information affects how people receive it. Consider the visual and structural composition of your communications, not just the verbal content.","Film School"
Film,5,"COLLABORATIVE CREATIVE PROCESS","Director Steven Spielberg builds films through collaboration with cinematographers, editors, composers, and actors, trusting each specialist's expertise. Great creative work emerges from bringing together diverse perspectives and skills rather than relying on individual genius. Create environments where different expertise can contribute and build on each other.","Film School"
Film,6,"SUBTEXT AND IMPLIED MEANING","Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman crafts dialogue where characters rarely say exactly what they mean. The most powerful communication often happens through implication and subtext rather than direct statement. Pay attention to what's not being said in conversations and meetings - often that's where the real information lies.","Film School"
Film,7,"PACING AND RHYTHM","Editor Hal Ashby understood that the rhythm of cuts and scenes affects audience engagement and emotional response. Even in non-creative contexts, pacing matters - the rhythm of meetings, the flow of presentations, the cadence of project milestones. Vary intensity and give people time to process important information.","Film School"
Film,8,"AUTHENTIC EMOTION","Method acting teacher Lee Strasberg taught actors to draw from genuine emotional experiences to create believable performances. Authenticity resonates more than technical perfection. When communicating or leading, connect with your genuine feelings about the subject rather than just presenting information professionally.","Film School"
Film,9,"POINT OF VIEW CONSISTENCY","Director Alfred Hitchcock carefully controlled whose perspective the audience experienced to create suspense and empathy. Be intentional about whose viewpoint you're presenting and stay consistent within that frame. Shifting perspectives without clear transitions confuses audiences and weakens impact.","Film School"
Film,10,"CONSTRAINT BREEDS CREATIVITY","Director Robert Rodriguez famously created 'El Mariachi' for $7,000 by embracing limitations and finding creative workarounds. Constraints often spark more innovative solutions than unlimited resources. When facing budget, time, or resource limitations, view them as creative challenges rather than obstacles.","Film School"
Medicine,1,"FIRST DO NO HARM","The fundamental principle of Hippocratic medicine teaches that avoiding harm is more important than providing benefit. Before implementing any intervention - whether medical, organizational, or technical - carefully consider potential negative consequences. Sometimes the wisest action is to do nothing and observe rather than intervene immediately.","School of Medicine"
Medicine,2,"DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS THINKING","Medical training emphasizes considering multiple possible explanations for symptoms rather than jumping to the first plausible diagnosis. When facing problems, generate several potential root causes before settling on a solution. The most obvious explanation isn't always correct, and confirming one possibility doesn't rule out others.","School of Medicine"
Medicine,3,"EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE","Modern medicine requires treatments to be supported by rigorous research rather than tradition or intuition. Before adopting new practices or technologies, look for solid evidence of effectiveness. Personal anecdotes and expert opinions are less reliable than systematic studies with control groups.","School of Medicine"
Medicine,4,"PATIENT-CENTERED CARE","Good physicians listen to patients' concerns and involve them in treatment decisions rather than simply prescribing solutions. When solving problems for others, start by understanding their perspective, priorities, and constraints. The technically optimal solution may not be the right solution for their specific situation.","School of Medicine"
Medicine,5,"SYSTEMATIC EXAMINATION","Medical diagnosis follows systematic protocols to avoid missing important information. Develop consistent processes for gathering information and analyzing problems rather than relying on ad hoc approaches. Systematic methods catch things that informal approaches miss, especially when you're tired or distracted.","School of Medicine"
Medicine,6,"PREVENTIVE INTERVENTION","Public health emphasizes preventing disease rather than just treating it after it occurs. In any system, identify potential problems early and address root causes rather than waiting for crises. Prevention is usually more effective and less costly than remediation, even though it's less visible and dramatic.","School of Medicine"
Medicine,7,"MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP","Medical treatment doesn't end with the initial intervention - careful monitoring determines whether treatments are working and catches complications early. After implementing solutions, establish regular check-ins to assess progress and identify emerging issues. Don't assume that good initial results will continue without ongoing attention.","School of Medicine"
Medicine,8,"MULTIDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION","Complex medical cases require input from specialists in different fields who bring unique perspectives and expertise. When facing complex challenges, actively seek input from people with different backgrounds and specialties. The intersection of different knowledge domains often reveals solutions that no single perspective could find.","School of Medicine"
Medicine,9,"TRIAGE PRIORITIZATION","Emergency medicine teaches rapid assessment of urgency and severity to allocate limited resources effectively. When managing multiple priorities, systematically assess which issues are most urgent and important rather than addressing them in random order. Not everything that seems urgent actually is, and not everything important is urgent.","School of Medicine"
Medicine,10,"CONTINUOUS LEARNING","Medical knowledge evolves rapidly, requiring physicians to continuously update their understanding and practices throughout their careers. Build learning and skill development into your regular routine rather than assuming your current knowledge will remain sufficient. What you learned initially may become obsolete or be refined by new discoveries.","School of Medicine"
Culinary,1,"MISE EN PLACE DISCIPLINE","French culinary tradition teaches that professional cooking begins with mise en place - having everything in its place before you start. Preparation and organization are more important than speed or flair. Before starting any complex project, take time to gather all necessary resources, information, and tools. Rushing into execution without proper preparation creates chaos.","Culinary School"
Culinary,2,"TASTE AS YOU GO","Chef Julia Child emphasized that great cooking requires constant tasting and adjustment throughout the process, not just following recipes blindly. When working on any project, build in regular check-points to assess progress and make adjustments. The final result depends on course corrections along the way, not just the initial plan.","Culinary School"
Culinary,3,"FRESH INGREDIENT QUALITY","Chef Alice Waters revolutionized American cuisine by insisting that great dishes start with the best possible raw ingredients. You cannot overcome poor foundation materials with technique alone. When starting projects, invest time in securing high-quality inputs - whether that's data, team members, or source materials.","Culinary School"
Culinary,4,"KNIFE SKILLS FUNDAMENTALS","Professional chefs spend enormous time mastering basic knife skills because consistent, precise cuts are the foundation of all cooking. Master the fundamental skills in your field thoroughly before moving to advanced techniques. Sloppy basics undermine everything else you try to build on top of them.","Culinary School"
Culinary,5,"SEASONING BALANCE","Great chefs understand that salt doesn't just make food salty - it enhances and balances all other flavors. In any system or process, identify the elements that don't add their own flavor but make everything else work better. These foundational elements often seem minor but have disproportionate impact on overall success.","Culinary School"
Culinary,6,"TEMPERATURE CONTROL","Cooking is largely about controlling temperature and timing. Different ingredients need different heat levels and cooking times to reach their potential. When managing projects or teams, recognize that different components need different types and intensities of attention. One size fits all approaches usually optimize nothing.","Culinary School"
Culinary,7,"KITCHEN BRIGADE SYSTEM","Auguste Escoffier's brigade system assigns specific roles and responsibilities to create efficient collaboration under pressure. Clear role definition and communication protocols become essential when stakes are high and timing is critical. Establish who does what before you're in crisis mode.","Culinary School"
Culinary,8,"CREATIVITY WITHIN CONSTRAINTS","Chef Ferran Adrià created revolutionary cuisine by imposing strict limitations and then finding creative solutions within those boundaries. Constraints often spark more innovation than unlimited freedom. When facing creative challenges, try imposing artificial limitations to force novel approaches.","Culinary School"
Culinary,9,"PRESENTATION MATTERS","Visual presentation affects how food tastes - the same dish plated beautifully will literally taste better to diners. How you present ideas, proposals, and work affects how they're received and evaluated. Invest time in thoughtful presentation, not just content creation.","Culinary School"
Culinary,10,"LEARNING FROM FAILURE","Every chef has disasters - burned sauces, collapsed soufflés, oversalted dishes. The key is understanding what went wrong and why so you can avoid repeating mistakes. When things go wrong in your work, resist the urge to quickly move on. Take time to understand the failure mechanism so you can prevent it in the future.","Culinary School"
