# System Architecture Design

## Overview

The Engagements platform is built as a serverless, real-time collaborative system using AWS services with a React frontend. The architecture follows microservices principles with clear separation of concerns.

## Core Principles

1. **Single Table Design** - All data in one DynamoDB table with efficient access patterns
2. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket connections for live collaboration
3. **Modular Infrastructure** - Separate CloudFormation stacks for different concerns
4. **Mobile-First** - Responsive design optimized for all devices
5. **Extensible** - Easy to add new engagement types and features

## Architecture Layers

### Frontend Layer
- **React SPA** - Single page application with component-based architecture
- **WebSocket Client** - Real-time communication with backend
- **State Management** - Local state with WebSocket synchronization
- **Responsive UI** - Mobile-first design with progressive enhancement

### API Layer
- **HTTP API Gateway** - RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- **WebSocket API Gateway** - Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Lambda Functions** - Serverless compute for business logic
- **CORS Configuration** - Proper cross-origin resource sharing

### Data Layer
- **DynamoDB Single Table** - All entities in one table with composite keys
- **TTL Management** - Automatic cleanup of expired data
- **Access Patterns** - Optimized queries, no scans
- **Backup Strategy** - Point-in-time recovery enabled

### Infrastructure Layer
- **CloudFormation Stacks** - Infrastructure as code
- **Modular Design** - Base stack + feature extensions
- **Environment Separation** - Dev/Test/Prod isolation
- **Resource Tagging** - Proper cost allocation and management

## Data Flow

### Game Creation Flow
1. Host creates game → Lambda validates → DynamoDB stores
2. Game ID generated → URL updated → QR code created
3. WebSocket connection established → Real-time sync enabled

### Player Join Flow
1. Player scans QR/enters ID → Validation → DynamoDB check
2. Player record created → WebSocket connection → Live updates

### Question Flow
1. Host starts question → State updated → WebSocket broadcast
2. Players submit answers → Aggregated in real-time
3. Voting phase → Results calculated → Scores updated

### Real-time Sync
1. All state changes broadcast via WebSocket
2. Clients maintain local state + server sync
3. Automatic reconnection on connection loss
4. Conflict resolution for concurrent updates

## Security Model

### Authentication
- No user accounts required for basic functionality
- Game IDs provide access control
- Admin functions require authentication (future)

### Authorization
- Game creators have host privileges
- Players can only modify their own data
- Read access controlled by game membership

### Data Protection
- TTL ensures automatic data cleanup
- No PII stored beyond session duration
- HTTPS/WSS for all communications

## Scalability Design

### Horizontal Scaling
- Lambda auto-scales with demand
- DynamoDB on-demand scaling
- API Gateway handles traffic spikes
- WebSocket connections distributed

### Performance Optimization
- Single table design minimizes API calls
- Efficient access patterns
- Client-side caching where appropriate
- Minimal payload sizes

### Cost Optimization
- Pay-per-use serverless model
- TTL reduces storage costs
- Efficient query patterns
- Resource right-sizing

## Monitoring & Observability

### Logging
- CloudWatch Logs for all Lambda functions
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Error tracking and alerting

### Metrics
- Custom CloudWatch metrics
- API Gateway metrics
- DynamoDB performance metrics
- WebSocket connection metrics

### Tracing
- X-Ray tracing for request flows
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Error root cause analysis

## Deployment Strategy

### Infrastructure
- CloudFormation for infrastructure as code
- Separate stacks for modularity
- Blue/green deployments for zero downtime
- Automated rollback on failures

### Application
- Webpack for frontend bundling
- S3 + CloudFront for static hosting
- Lambda versioning and aliases
- Automated testing pipeline

### Environments
- Development: Full feature testing
- Staging: Production-like validation
- Production: Live system with monitoring

## Extension Points

### New Engagement Types
- Plugin architecture for new game modes
- Standardized interfaces
- Minimal core changes required

### Integration Capabilities
- Webhook support for external systems
- API for third-party integrations
- Export capabilities for data analysis

### Advanced Features
- User accounts and profiles
- Advanced analytics
- Custom branding
- Enterprise features

This architecture provides a solid foundation for the current requirements while enabling future growth and feature additions.
